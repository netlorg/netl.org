    <h1>netl.org</h1>
    <p>
       <tt>netl</tt> was my first open-source project.  Well, sort of.  I mean I released it as open-source, and at least one
       obsecure Linux distribution added it to their repository.  <tt>netl</tt> was one of the first network sniffers to detect
       stealth scans by <tt>nmap<tt> which was being developed on the same university residential networks.

       However, nobody other than myself actually worked on the project
       (to me, the mark of a successful open source project is at least a few contributors), and
       even if <tt>netl</tt> did compile on modern Linux, there are better alternatives today, like
       <a href="https://www.wireshark.org/">wireshark</a>.  Still, this little project has a soft spot in my heart for being
       the first thing that "put out there".  So.  I am keeping the domain.  For now.
